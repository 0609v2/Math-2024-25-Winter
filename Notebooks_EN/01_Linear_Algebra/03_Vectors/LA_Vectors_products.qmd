## Scalar Product

The scalar product (also called the dot product) of two vectors is an operation that returns a scalar value. It is defined as the sum of the products of the corresponding components of two vectors.

For two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ in the space $\mathbb{R}^n$, where:

$$
\mathbf{a} = [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n], \quad \mathbf{b} = [b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n]
$$

The scalar product is defined as follows:

$$
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \dots + a_nb_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i
$$

Example for three-dimensional space ($ \mathbb{R}^3 $):

For vectors $\mathbf{a} = [a_1, a_2, a_3]$ and $\mathbf{b} = [b_1, b_2, b_3]$, the scalar product is:

$$ 
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3
$$

The scalar product returns a number that measures the "similarity of direction" between two vectors. If $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0$, the vectors are perpendicular.

Alternatively, the scalar product can be expressed as:

$$
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos(	heta),
$$
which is the product of the magnitudes of vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ multiplied by the cosine of the angle between them.

## Vector Product

The vector product (also called the cross product) is an operation that returns a new vector perpendicular to the two input vectors. It is defined only in three-dimensional space $ \mathbb{R}^3 $.

For two vectors $ \mathbf{a} = [a_1, a_2, a_3] $ and $ \mathbf{b} = [b_1, b_2, b_3] $, the vector product $ \mathbf{a} 	imes \mathbf{b} $ is defined as:

$$ \mathbf{a} 	imes \mathbf{b} =
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\
b_1 & b_2 & b_3
\end{vmatrix}
$$

Where $ \mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k} $ are unit vectors along the $ x, y, z $ axes. Interestingly, to calculate the vector product and obtain the resulting vector, we use the determinant (a scalar) of the matrix (a second-order tensor) whose rows are the basis vectors (vectors) and the components of the vectors (scalars).

The vector product can be expressed in expanded form:

$$ \mathbf{a} 	imes \mathbf{b} = \left( a_2b_3 - a_3b_2 \right)\mathbf{i} - \left( a_1b_3 - a_3b_1 \right)\mathbf{j} + \left( a_1b_2 - a_2b_1 \right)\mathbf{k} $$

The result of the vector product is a new vector:

$$ \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{a} 	imes \mathbf{b} = [a_2b_3 - a_3b_2, a_3b_1 - a_1b_3, a_1b_2 - a_2b_1] $$

The vector product returns a vector $\mathbf{c}$ perpendicular to the plane defined by $ \mathbf{a} $ and $ \mathbf{b} $, and its magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram whose sides are defined by the vectors $ \mathbf{a} $ and $ \mathbf{b} $
$$
|\mathbf{c}| = |\mathbf{a}| |\mathbf{b}| \sin \theta
$$

where $	heta$ is the angle between the vectors. The direction of vector $ec{c}$ is determined by the right-hand rule.

## Mixed Product

The mixed product of three vectors $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c}$ is defined as:

$$
\mathbf{a} \cdot \left( \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} \right)
$$

This is equivalent to the scalar product $\mathbf{a} \times \left( \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} \right)$.

The mixed product is equal to zero if the vectors $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c}$ are collinear or parallel.

The volume of the parallelepiped defined by three vectors $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c}$ is equal to the absolute value of the mixed product of these vectors.

## Implementation

```{python}
import sympy as sp 
# Vector definitions
a = sp.Matrix([1, 2, 3])
b = sp.Matrix([4, 5, 6])
c = sp.Matrix([7, 0, 9])
d = sp.Matrix([0, 2, 0])
```

```{python}
# Display vector c
c
```

```{python}
# Adding vectors a and b
a + b
```

```{python}
# Dot product of a and b
(1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6) == a.dot(b)
```

```{python}
# Cross product of a and c
# a = [1, 2, 3]
# c = [7, 0, 9]

# As an aid, write the vectors as 3x3 matrices
# i, j, k
# 1, 2, 3
# 7, 0, 9

# Now
comp1 = (2*9 - 3*0)
comp2 = -(1*9 - 3*7)
comp3 = (1*0 - 2*7)

# Result
sp.Matrix([comp1, comp2, comp3]) == a.cross(c)
```

```{python}
# Perpendicularity of vectors
# c = [7, 0, 9]
# d = [0, 2, 0]

# If the dot product of vectors is equal to 0, they are perpendicular
dot_product = 7*0 + 0*2 + 9*0
dot_product == 0
```

## Applications

### Calculating the Angle Between Vectors

$$
\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\|}
$$

### Checking Vector Perpendicularity

Vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are perpendicular if their dot product is zero:
$$
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0 
\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad
 \mathbf{a} \perp \mathbf{b}
$$

### Finding Projections of Vectors onto Other Vectors

$$
\text{Projection} = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{b}\|}
$$

### Calculating Work Done by a Force in Physics

For a force $\mathbf{F} = (F_x, F_y, F_z)$ acting along a displacement $\mathbf{d} = (d_x, d_y, d_z)$, work is calculated as:

$$
W = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{d} = |\mathbf{F}| |\mathbf{d}| \cos \theta = F_x d_x + F_y d_y + F_z d_z
$$

### Torque

In physics: torque is the vector product of the force vector and the arm of the force:

$$
\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}
$$

### Calculating the Area of a Parallelogram

The area of a parallelogram spanned by two vectors:

$$
\text{Area}_{r} = \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = |\mathbf{a}| |\mathbf{b}| \sin \theta
$$

### Calculating the Area of a Triangle

The area of a triangle spanned by two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$:

$$
\text{Area}_{t} = \frac{1}{2} |\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}|
$$

### Calculating the Volume of Parallelepipeds and Tetrahedrons

The mixed product of vectors is used to calculate the volume of parallelepipeds and tetrahedrons. For three vectors **$\mathbf{a}$**, **$\mathbf{b}$**, and **$\mathbf{c}$**, the volume of the parallelepiped is given by:

$$
V = |\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})|
$$
(Note: **| |** here denotes the absolute value, not the magnitude!)

### Checking Coplanarity of Three Vectors

If the mixed product of three vectors is equal to zero, it means that the vectors are coplanar. Otherwise, they form a tetrahedron.
